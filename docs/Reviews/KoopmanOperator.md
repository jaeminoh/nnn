# Koopman Operator

- [ ] [Paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-07210-0)

> Koopman operator theory, developed in 1931, has recently
emerged as a leading candidate for the systematic linear repre-
sentation of nonlinear systems.

> Eigenfunctions of the Koopman operator are now widely
sought, as they provide intrinsic coordinates that globally line-
arize nonlinear dynamics.

> However, a current challenge in deep learning research is the
identification of parsimonious, interpretable, and transferable
models.

> Our approach differs from previous studies,
as we are focused specifically on obtaining parsimonious models
that match the intrinsic low-rank dynamics while avoiding
overfitting and remaining interpretable, thus merging the best of
DNN architectures and Koopman theory.
